## Getting Started

1) Contact Neustar CI API (<ciapi@team.neustar>) team to get your credentials. A **Service ID (or SID)**, **Username** and **Password** will be provided.
2) Ensure that your Treasure Data environment is configured to allow running custom **[python scripts](https://docs.treasuredata.com/display/public/PD/Introduction+to+Custom+Scripts)**.
3) Install the **[Treasure Data Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/)** on your local machine (supports MacOS, Linux & Windows). Once installed, login into your Treaure Data environment remotely by running `td account`.
```
td account
```

## Steps
1) Download the Treasure Box by cloning this repository to your local machine and then `cd` into it.
```
git clone ssh://git@git.nexgen.neustar.biz:8022/treasurebox/neustar_treasurebox.git nsr_tb
cd nsr_tb
```
2) Upload this Treasure Box to your Treasure Data environment by using the Toolbelt. If you are performing this operation for the first time, the Toolbel will require you to install the `workflow` module.
```
td wf push neustar_ciapi_integration                                                                       
```

3) Now login into your **[Treasure Data Console](https://console.treasuredata.com/)** in a browser to confirm that the workflow has been uploaded successfully.
